# Prequel
This presentation and these examples are all about the latest security features in .NET 9.

## Why bother?
For many years the focus of application security has been on the Ops-teams. Their magical firewall and DMZs would make sure that notthing would happen to the application. Over time this notion changed. What would happen if the intruder would be in the network? What if a package would be compromised? It requires a redical different approach to security.

## Principles

Microsoft and many other big tech like Google and AWS have started to talk a few years ago about Zero Trust. The idea is that you rather trust nobody and actively assume that you're breached.

## How?
So how can you do this?

Often the focus is still on the Network or the Host where the application runs. Today I'll do the opposite. I focus on the application and all Microsoft is currently doing to make sure you hammer this thing down.
